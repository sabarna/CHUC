Description: # CHUC
        
        CHUC (or Conversion Homogeneity based Uplift Computation) is a Python package to compute the incremental effect treatment (eg: Marketing Ad impression) has on a subject's probability to convert (or expected revenue).
        
        # Training Algorithm
        - Group customers based on their probability to convert using the holdout set -using a Classification (if outcome is binomial) or Regression (if outcome is continuous) model **M1** 
        - Compute the empirical uplift on each of the groups
        - Build a regression model, **M2**, that maps conversion to uplift based on the above observations
        # Scoring Algorithm
          - Using **M1** assign every observation into a group
          - Using **M2** predict Uplift for that group
        
        # Installation
        ```sh
        pip install chuc
        ```
        # Training
        ```sh
        #df -> dataframe containing testlabel, outcome and predictors  
        #treatmentLabel -> Column name of the treatmen label
        #outcome -> Column name of the outcome variable
        
        import chuc
        # Instantiating the uplift object with no hyperparamter tuning
        u=chuc.Uplift(df,'testgroup', 'conversion') 
        
        #Instanting the model object to train M1 with hyperparameter tuning
        p_={'max_depth':list(range(2,15,1)), 
            'min_child_weight': list(range(10,300)),
            'n_estimators':list(range(50,400)),
            'gamma': sc.stats.uniform(0.1, 0.9),
            'subsample':sc.stats.uniform(0.6, 0.4)}
        u=chuc.Uplift(df,treatmentLabel= 'testgroup', outcome= 'converted',p_)
        
        #Fitting the model
        u.fit()
        
        #Getting diagnostics plot 
        u.getDiagnostics()
        ```
        
        # Predicting
        ```sh
        uplift=u.predictUplift(df_test)
        ```
